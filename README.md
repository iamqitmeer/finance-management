## **About The Project**

Managing personal finances can often feel overwhelming. Whether it's tracking expenses, managing income, or planning for taxes, these tasks demand precision and time. This **Financial Management Application** was created as a comprehensive solution to these challenges.

Initially inspired by a personal challenge of accurately tracking income and saving for taxes, the app evolved into a robust tool featuring:

- **Expense Tracking** to monitor and categorize spending.
- **Income Tracking** to log and analyze earnings.
- **Tax Calculations** to simplify financial planning.
- **Budget Planning** based on the 50/30/20 rule for effective financial management.

This project not only highlights my technical skills but also demonstrates my ability to design solutions for real-world problems.
